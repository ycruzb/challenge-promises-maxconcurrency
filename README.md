# Challenge

## Information

Given an array of URLs and a MAX_CONCURRENCY integer, implement a function that will
asynchronously fetch each URL, not requesting more than MAX_CONCURRENCY URLs at the
same time. The URLs should be fetched as soon as possible. The function should return an
array of responses for each URL. How would you write a test for such a function?

## Run the project locally
